# üìÇ Data Folder

This folder contains sample or placeholder datasets used in the **Weather Forecast & Air Quality Dashboard** project.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
- The original data is fetched live from **OpenWeatherMap API** and **Air Quality API** using Power Query in Power BI.  
- Since API keys are required, raw live data is **not stored** in this repository.  
- Instead, a **sample CSV file** (`sample_weather_data.csv`) is provided for demonstration and testing purposes.  

## Contents
- `sample_weather_data.csv` ‚Üí Contains mock weather and air quality data for dashboard demo.  

## How to Use
1. For live data, set up your own **API key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
2. Replace the API connection in Power Query with your key.  
3. Refresh the dashboard to load real-time data.
